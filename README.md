# Android Assignment 2

## Assessment Details

Vietnam Sach va Xanh has run 4 Earth Day Clean Ups where individuals and organisations can join to help pick up trash at different cleanup locations around Vietnam. Last year we had over 40+ locations across the country with about 3000 people joining. Now, we would like to enhance this helpful activity, to have an extremely large turn-out, but in order to do that we will need a better online system to help us manage locations and communications.  

The system offers the following functionalities:

* Ability for Clean Up Location Owners to create accounts,
* Set up Clean Up Locations
* Download lists of people who join their clean-ups
* Input data after the clean ups (i.e. how much was collected).
* Ability for Volunteers to view registered clean up locations on a map
* Click on locations
* Register themselves (and friends) to a location
* Ability for Vietnam Sach Va Xanh to run reports on the outcomes of the different cleanup locations (# of volunteers, Amount of waste collected... other data.).

If you are still now clear about how the system works, please refer to the following websites. Try to create account and be owner of a cleaning site to get an idea how a real system looks like.
