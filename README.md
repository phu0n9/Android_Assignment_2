# Android Assignment 2

## Assessment Details

Vietnam Sach va Xanh has run 4 Earth Day Clean Ups where individuals and organisations can join to help pick up trash at different cleanup locations around Vietnam. Last year we had over 40+ locations across the country with about 3000 people joining. Now, we would like to enhance this helpful activity, to have an extremely large turn-out, but in order to do that we will need a better online system to help us manage locations and communications.  

The system offers the following functionalities:

- [x] Ability for Clean Up Location Owners to create accounts,
- [x] Set up Clean Up Locations
- [x] Download lists of people who join their clean-ups
- [x] Input data after the clean ups (i.e. how much was collected).
- [x] Ability for Volunteers to view registered clean up locations on a map
- [x] Click on locations
- [x] Register themselves (and friends) to a location
- [ ] Ability for Vietnam Sach Va Xanh to run reports on the outcomes of the different cleanup locations (# of volunteers, Amount of waste collected... other data.).
- [x] A map view that shows nearby all available clean up sites. The number of sites to be shown will depend on the zoom level and camera view. Students are free to build their own rules. Customized markers should be used (not the default provided by Android). Be creative. When users click on a site, detailed info of the site should be displayed. 
- [x] Users should be able to filter/search sites based on criteria.
- [x] Users can join a site by creating an account and sign in
- [x] Users can create new site and be admin of that site. As the admin of the site, user can see the list of people who sign up for the site.
- [x] There should be notifications to users when there is changes in a site
- [x] Super user of the app can see all sites.
- [x] Can find routes from current user location to the site

If you are still now clear about how the system works, please refer to the following websites. Try to create account and be owner of a cleaning site to get an idea how a real system looks like.
